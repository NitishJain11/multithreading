    "# Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to simultaneously execute multiple threads of \n",

    "# thread, and can perform tasks in parallel with other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Multithreading is useful for improving the performance and responsiveness of a program by allowing it to perform \n",
    "# multiple tasks in parallel. For example, a program that needs to perform a long-running computation could create a\n",

    "# input and update the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "# #The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading. It provides a simple and powerful interface for\n",

    "# start them, wait for them to finish, and communicate between threads using various synchronization primitives such as\n",
    "# locks, semaphores, and events. The threading module also includes other useful features such as timers and daemon threads.\n",

    "# Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to utilize multiple \n",
    "# cores of a CPU or multiple CPUs. This can result in faster execution times for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Better resource utilization: Multithreading allows a program to make better use of system resources, such as memory \n",
    "# and I/O devices. This is because multiple threads can share resources instead of each thread requiring its own set of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enhanced responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to continue executing other \n",
    "# tasks while waiting for I/O operations or other blocking calls to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simplified program design: Multithreading can simplify program design by allowing a program to be broken down into smaller,\n",
    "# more manageable tasks that can be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Increased complexity: Multithreading can add complexity to a program, making it more difficult to design, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "# Multithreading requires careful synchronization and coordination of threads to avoid race conditions and other synchronization issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Increased memory usage: Multithreading can increase the memory usage of a program, as each thread requires its own stack and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Increased overhead: Multithreading can introduce additional overhead due to the need for thread creation, synchronization, and context switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Difficult to debug: Multithreaded programs can be difficult to debug, as thread interactions can be unpredictable and difficult to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Potential for deadlock: Multithreaded programs can be prone to deadlock, where multiple threads are waiting for resources that are held by other\n",
